Welcome to Tweety's documentation. Get started with :doc:`installation`
and then get an overview with the :doc:`quickstart`. The rest of the docs describe each
component of Tweety in detail, with a full reference in the :doc:`all_functions`
section.

Twitter's API is annoying to work with, and has lots of limitations — luckily their frontend (JavaScript) has it's own API, which I reverse–engineered. No API rate limits. No restrictions. Extremely fast.
