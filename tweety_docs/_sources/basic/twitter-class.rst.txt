Twitter Class
=============

The Twitter aggregates several mixin classes to provide all the common functionality in a nice, Pythonic interface. Each mixin has its own methods, which you all can use.

.. py:class:: Twitter(session_name: Union[str, Session], proxy: Union[dict, Proxy] = None)


    Bases : `UpdateMethods` , `BotMethods`, `AuthMethods`

    .. py:data:: Arguments

        .. py:data:: session_name
            :type: str | Session

            This is the name of the session which will be saved and can be loaded later

        .. py:data:: proxy (optional)
            :type: dict | Proxy
            :value: None

            Proxy you want to use

            .. warning:: Proxy is not yet fully integrated
